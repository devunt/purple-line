purple-line
===========

libpurple (Pidgin, Finch) protocol plugin for LINE (http://line.naver.jp/en/) by Naver / NHN Japan. It's not quite featureful and stable enough to be used as a primary client for Line yet, but it's under heavy development.

The LINE protocol is closed, proprietary and there is no public API nor a truly cross-platform client (how lame!), so this repository shall also serve as unofficial documentation for the LINE protocol.

Implemented
-----------

* Logging in
* Fetching user profile
* Initial friend list synchronization
* Sending and receiving text IMs

To do

* Synchronizing things while connected
* Joining/leaving groups
* Inviting people to groups
* Fetching recent messages when opening a conversation
* "Show more history" button (if doable)
* Other message types (stickers, images, etc)
