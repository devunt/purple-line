purple-line
===========

libpurple (Pidgin, Finch) protocol plugin for LINE (http://line.naver.jp/en/) by Naver / NHN Japan. It's not quite featureful and stable enough to be used as a primary client for Line yet, but it's under heavy development.

The LINE protocol is closed, proprietary and there is no public API nor a truly cross-platform client (how lame!), so this repository shall also serve as unofficial documentation for the LINE protocol.
