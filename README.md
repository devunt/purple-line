**Warning: Unfinished software!** This plugin is still under development and many things are still unstable or unimplemented.

purple-line
===========

libpurple (Pidgin, Finch) protocol plugin for LINE (http://line.me/) by Naver / LINE Corporation.

The LINE protocol is closed, proprietary and there is no public API nor a truly cross-platform client (how lame!). Therefore, I'm seeing if I can implement a usable libpurple plugin for it and I'm documenting the protocol as I go (documentation at https://github.com/mvirkkunen/line-protocol/)

Does it work?
-------------

Yes, to an extent. Here's Pidgin logged in to LINE, but it's not quite stable and featureful enough to be used as one's main LINE client yet.

How to install
--------------

    make
    make install

This will build and install the plugin into your home directory. The prerequisites are a recent C++ compiler, the Apache Thrift compiler and libraries, and libpurple. Builds are only tested on Arch Linux for now.

Easy to install packages will not be available until I get all the main features implemented.
