purple-line
===========

libpurple protocol plugin for LINE (http://line.naver.jp/en/) by Naver / NHN Japan. It's under
heavy development and currently all it does is log into LINE. It doesn't do anything useful yet.

The LINE protocol is closed, proprietary and there is no public API nor a truly cross-platform
client (how lame!), so this repository shall also serve as unofficial documentation for the LINE
protocol.
